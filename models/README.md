# Machine Learning Models Directory

This directory will store trained ML models as you build trading history.

## Future Model Files:
- `profitability_model.pkl` - Trained profitability prediction model
- `return_prediction_model.pkl` - Expected return estimation model
- `risk_assessment_model.pkl` - Risk scoring model
- `feature_scaler.pkl` - Data preprocessing scaler
- `model_metadata.json` - Training statistics and performance metrics

## Model Development:
- Models train automatically as you log trades
- Minimum 50 trades needed for effective training
- Weekly retraining schedule (configurable)
- Performance validation and accuracy tracking

## Current System:
The enhanced system uses sophisticated **rule-based profitability analysis** 
that doesn't require pre-trained models:
- Technical analysis algorithms
- Momentum scoring systems  
- Value assessment frameworks
- Volume intelligence processing
- Volatility optimization engines

As you log actual trades, the system will eventually supplement these
rule-based systems with personalized ML models trained on your outcomes.
